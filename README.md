# Week 2 Git Lab

This repository is for practicing Git branching, merge conflicts, and release tagging.

## Files
- `team.md` – used by Pair 1 (A & B) to simulate a merge conflict.
- `mission.md` – used by Pair 2 (C & D) to simulate a merge conflict.

## Phases
1. **Pair Work – Merge Conflict Simulation**
   - Pair 1: feature-A & feature-B (team.md)
   - Pair 2: feature-C & feature-D (mission.md)
2. **Undo Mistakes**
   - Practice `git revert` and `git reset --hard`
3. **Tag Final Release**
   - Tag v1.0 after all merges are complete
